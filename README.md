# Bates_MQE
Multi-Asset Option Pricing under the Bates Model

de Innocentis et al. (2016) have proposed an efficient simulation that based on Andersenâ€™s (2008) Quadratic Exponential (QE) scheme called the multi-asset Heston QE scheme (Heston MQE scheme), which has also shown robust convergence on the terminal correlations to the true terminal correlations. These codes extend the Heston MQE scheme to the Bates (1996) stochastic-volatility jump-diffusion model, proposing the Bates MQE scheme.
